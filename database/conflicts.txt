added _v2 to some models from snark. Once a model is distributed by a server,
that name should never be used again, or else clients won't get the updated file.

added _v2 to some recent models that already existed in the 2017 version of the 
TWLZ player model pack. Sometimes _v3 and _v4 were added to match chronological
dates of the models, meaning the original name isn't used anymore because I only
know for sure that the _v2 version is correctly named (e.g. rouge -> rouge_v3 instead
of swapping rouge_v2 and rouge).

added _v2 to models that were updated on GameBanana without being renamed.

added "_ld" to all player models from this pack:

They overwrite the default player models otherwise.

added "_up" to the upscaled texture they hunger pack
