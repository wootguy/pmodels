Recently released models that I renamed because an older model had the same name:
elvis -> pd_elvis
simon -> 7ds_simon
cof_simon -> cof_simon_v2

added _v2 to some models from snark. Once a model is distributed by a server,
that name should never be used again, or else clients won't get the updated file.
