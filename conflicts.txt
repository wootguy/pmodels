Recently released models that I renamed because an older model had the same name:
elvis -> pd_elvis
simon -> 7ds_simon
cof_simon -> cof_simon_v2
jill -> jill_grey
Touhou_Momiji -> kz_touhou_momiji
Venom -> VenomReal_v2
warrior_skeleton -> warrior_skeleton_2
Zombie2 -> th_zombie2
pyro -> pyro_hecu
cryokeen -> cryokeen_hd
demon -> demon2
grunt -> grunt2
hgrunt_hd -> hgrunt_hd_v2
hgrunt -> hgrunt_hd
vamp -> vamp2
alien -> alien2
avp2pred -> avp2pred2
crash_bandicoot -> crash_bandicoot2
fishman -> fishman2
hatsunemiku_10a -> hatsunemiku_10a2
james -> james2
kancolle_harbour -> kancolle_harbour2
shadow1 -> shadow2_v2
tails -> tails_ld
vocaloid_miku -> vocaloid_miku2

added _v2 to some models from snark. Once a model is distributed by a server,
that name should never be used again, or else clients won't get the updated file.

added _v2 to some recent models that already existed in the a 2017 version of the 
TWLZ player model pack. Sometimes _v3 and _v4 were added to match chronological
dates of the models, meaning the original name isn't used anymore because I only
know for sure that the _v2 version is correctly named (e.g. rouge -> rouge_v3 instead
of swapping rouge_v2 and rouge). Some of these are very obviously not a _v2, but a
completely different model.
