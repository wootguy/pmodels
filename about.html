			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				The in-game model browser is buggy and hard to use.
				Use this site instead to find a model, then use it in game
				by typing a model command in console (example: "model betagordon").
				You can click on a model's name to copy its name to the clipboard.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This site is a combination of various packs and single releases. There are often conflicts where models
				have the same names. I try to add version suffixes properly but might not always get that right.
				If I can't compare modified dates, then I check the animations to see which version should be the latest.
			</p>

			<h2>Model Names</h2>
			<p>
				People often copy-paste models and then rename them. These renamed models then get distributed in model packs.
				Because of this, I don't know if any of the model names here are correct. <a href="https://github.com/wootguy/scmodels/issues/new">Let me know</a>
				if a model name is wrong and I'll fix it (preferably with some proof like a GameBanana link).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some recently released models have names that conflict with older models. I renamed those models.
				For instance, this <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/167133">Touhou Momiji</a> model overwrites
				the low definition version of that model. So, I renamed the new one to "kz_touhou_momiji".
				There are <a href="database/conflicts.txt">many other</a> cases like this.
				You can also see previous model names in the "Known Aliases" section of the model viewer.
